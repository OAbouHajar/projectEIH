EIH: Emergency Info Hub
=======================================

What is EIH?
-------------
Emergency Info Hub ([EIH](https://eih.pythonanywhere.com/)),is a fourth year student project, has been designed to be a central website helps the emergency services to prepare for, respond to & recover from disaster, by providing all needed data for the targeted building (E.g. Number of people, area size and emergency exits).
The main objective of this project is giving the number of trapped people under rubbles or inside a building, by tracking their number using a simple movement sensor fitted on the main gate and face detection technology, and save this number to the cloud to be used when a disaster happens.

See [the documentation](http://glasnost.itcarlow.ie/~softeng4/C00220135/index.html#t3) for more detailes.

EIH Story
------------

The story of EIH started at that day when this photo was taken (the website background), back to 2012 during the Syrian war,
when I was among those guys running to help the people stuck under rubbles.
during this moments the one and the only question you will hear is: ANYBODY HERE?

The hours, the minutes and even the Seconds might be a reason to give someone a new life. calling again and again... ANYBODY HERE?, feeling bad if any one left behind with no help.

ANYBODY HERE? it's the reason to start, and here where we are: EIH - "EVERY LIFE MATTERS".
